C# & Raylib Snake Game - Real-time Rendering Implementation

In this project, C# and the Raylib library were used instead of a ready-made game engine. 
The goal is to develop the ability to build the Game Loop, Delta Time management, 2D Rendering fundamentals, and Input Handling mechanics from scratch using pure code.
